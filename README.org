This is a quick and dirty binding of the webGL spec
(https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/) for haste. Modules
are arranged by (and type signatures were obtained from) their
location on the quick reference card located at
https://www.khronos.org/files/webgl/webgl-reference-card-1_0.pdf .

** Examples

A couple of examples from "Learning WebGL" (http://learningwebgl.com/)
